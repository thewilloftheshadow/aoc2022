# Day 1

This seemed like a simple enough problem. I've parsed text files pretty often and this is pretty neatly structured.
I just wrote a bunch of functions to convert it to an array and then perform operations on that array.

Part 2 was extremely simple after that, since I already had the array, so I could just sum together the first 3 items in the array.

| Part   | Time |
| ------ | ---- |
| Part 1 | 4:13 |
| Part 2 | 0:24 |
