# Day 6

Originally, I read part 1 wrong and was trying to find the part where they were identical. After I fixed that, though, it was pretty straightforward. I just created a checker array with 4 elements and slowly cycled the string through it, checking for a match.

For part 2, I literally just had to change the length of the checker array on line 18.
