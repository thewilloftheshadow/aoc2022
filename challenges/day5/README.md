# Day 5

Finally, some really difficult stuff
This one took a lot of work, as I struggled to parse the crates correctly into stacks I could manipulate.
Once I had that sorted, however, it was pretty easy from there. I ended up using some regex to split the crates and then loop through those to move them. It was pretty fun to watch them go in the debugger.
