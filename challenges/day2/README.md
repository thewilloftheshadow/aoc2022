# Day 2

This one seemed like another simple but fun problem to figure out. Since I am using JS and not TS, I wanted to use simple, cleanly named variables and functions for this so I wouldn't get lost.

Part 1 was relatively straightforward, and I got the answer quickly.

Part 2 was a bit more difficult, because I forgot to restructure one portion of the code to work with the new constraints given by the elf.
