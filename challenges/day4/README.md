# Day 4

Today posed an interesting problem. I had never really worked with number ranges like that before, so... I made them arrays again! This seems to be a common thread so far...

Part 1 took quite a bit of time, as I was originally trying to compare the range strings directly. Eventually I just created arrays of the entire range (such as `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`) and then compared those.

Part 2 was literally the easiest thing ever. All I had to do was change `.every()` to `.some()` and the problem was complete. Most of the time was reading the problem itself!
